The TDS Entity Catalog includes several feature types (e.g., classification plus
geometry) that are described as "geometry not included" or "Feature only in the EC"
and these feature types are noted as "not allowed" by associated extraction guide.
Such "EG disallowed" features will be included in GAIT projects (when present), but 
will only be inspected for schema violations (e.g., attribute data type) and only those
geometric inspections that are applied to all feature types (e.g., duplication) will be
applied to these features as part of Master Profile inspections.
TDS features in this category and included in this project are listed below
