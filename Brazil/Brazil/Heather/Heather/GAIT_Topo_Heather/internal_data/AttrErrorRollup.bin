5. Domain-specific pick-list errors occur when a value assigned
   to a recognized attribute attached to a feature with a recognized FCODE
   is not a member of the associated domain of allowed pick-list values.

   Attributes with domain-specific pick list errors: 0


6. Unexpected FCODE - geometry pair errors occur when a feature has a recognized
   FCODE but the geometry of the feature (e.g. point, line, area) has not
   been associated with an instance of that FCODE in the current schema

   FCODES with unexpected FCODE - geometry pair errors: 0


7. Value range errors occur when a value has been assigned to a
   recognized attribute and that value is outside (e.g., above or below)
   the range of valid values prescribed for use with that feature (FCODE),
   attribute, and geometry.

   Attributes with value range errors: 0


8. Unexpected attribute errors occur when a recognized
   attribute is assigned to a feature having a recognized FCODE and that
   attribute is not a member of the list of attributes prescribed for use
   with features having the FCODE and geometry.

   Attributes with unexpected attribute errors: 1

9. Missing attribute field or value errors occur when a specific
   attribute has been designated as mandatory for assignment to a feature
   (according to the assigned classification and geometry), and one or more of
   those attributes is not associated with the feature in the GAIT project.
   Attributes may be reported as missing when: 1) there is no field for the
   attribute in the input data; 2) the field name is not exactly the same as the
   attrbute code; 3) the correct field appears in the input data, but the value
   for a specific record is invalid.  Any attributes reported in the below list
   should be cross-checked with other errors reported as: 1) Unrecognized Column
   Names (see Input Data Anomalies); 2) Blank Attribute errors; and 3) Non
   Domain Specific Pick-list errors.

10.TDS v6 attribute dependency errors occur when the allowed value
   of one attribute depends on the value assigned to another attribute - as
   an example, if a river is designated as intermittent or dry, then it may
   also be required to be non-tidal, so river features described as dry and
   tide-influenced would violate this dependency relationship.

   Attributes involved in TDS attribute dependency errors: 0


11.GAIT recognizes both 3-character and 17-character codes for the
   "(Location Country) Designation : GENC Short URN-based Identifier"
   set of attributes (ZI020_GE4, ZI020_GE42, ZI020_GE43, and ZI020_GE44).
   The sentinel codes "other" and "noInformation" are also recognized.
   Frequency counts for these 3 catgories of code values are provided below.

12.TDS metadata errors occur when the metadata is not in compliance
   with the requirements detailed in the spreadsheet "TDS_6_1_20140424"
   version dated 24 April, 2014.  Example errors include
   cases of missing attributes that are required, invalid pick list values,
   and the assignment of invalid values given the existing values for other
   metadata attributes.
